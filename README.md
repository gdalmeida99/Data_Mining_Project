# Data Mining Project

Project developed for the course of Data Mining during the first semester of the Master's degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics.

This project's goal was to segment donors from the Paralyzed Veterans of America association, using clustering techniques, and then present a simple marketing recommendation plan to increase donations. The data used was briefly updated from the one used in the KKD Cup of 1998. 

Here you can find the jupyter notebook written in Python, and the report delivered, explaining the steps followed and the marketing strategy proposed. This project follows the full steps of data pre-processing (including outlier detection and remotion and dimensionality reduction), the modelling phase (with attempt of diverse clustering algorithms -e.g., SOM, K-Means, GMM - and evaluation strategies) and the visualization of the results achieved (with techniques as the T-SNE).
